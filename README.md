# ASUS pairing utility for ROG and TUF devices

You can use this utility to pair an ASUS ROG/TUF mouse or keyboard with a separately obtained OEM dongle (from eBay, Aliexpress, etc.). This is useful if you broke/lost your original dongle or bought a product second-hand that didn't include one.


The utility is very finicky It does provide vague instructions on how to pair your device or at least it should. 

## 🔌 Device Dongle Pairing Limitations

Based on my limited testing, I was **unable to pair a device's dongle to a different device (One that it was not coded for)**. This suggests that you **cannot reuse a dongle** that was originally intended for a specific peripheral (e.g., a mouse dongle cannot be paired to a different mouse/keyboard).

### Purchasing Replacement Dongles

* You can purchase (supposedly) new replacement dongles from marketplaces like **eBay and AliExpress**.
* **Crucially**, you must ensure the replacement dongle is the **exact one intended for the device you possess**.
* (I am not aware of any known workaround for this.)

### Pairing Utility Performance

The pairing **utility can be finicky at times, but it does work**. If the device you are trying to pair to a new dongle is **not listed** in the utility's menu, this typically indicates one of three issues:

1.  **Device Not Supported:** The peripheral you are using may not be supported by the utility or dongle.
2.  **Dongle Mismatch:** The dongle is not correctly coded for the device you are trying to pair. (It's not as easy as looking for a specific model as far as I'm aware they are all the same model which is "ASUSDONGLE".)
3.  **Detection Failure:** The utility has not detected that the peripheral has been plugged in.

#### Troubleshooting Detection Failure

In the case where the peripheral has not been detected, you can usually resolve the issue by:

* **Unplugging and replugging** the device.
* **Restarting** the pairing program.

**All devices are untested except for the ones that are specified as tested**

***If you have successfully used this utility on a device that is listed (or not) please let me know and I will mark it as working/tested***
