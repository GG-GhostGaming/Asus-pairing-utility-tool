# ASUS pairing utility for ROG and TUF devices

You can use this utility to pair an ASUS ROG/TUF mouse or keyboard with a separately obtained dongle (from eBay, Aliexpress, etc.). This is useful if you broke or lost your original dongle or bought a product second-hand that didn't include one.

**All devices are untested except for the ones that are specified as tested**

***If you have successfully used this utility on a device that is listed (or not) please let me know and I will mark it as working***
